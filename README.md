# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Different R algorithms for solving the travelling salesman problem (TSP).

# Directory
Ensure you are in the directory where you want your plots to be saved. This will also be the same directory which you would import any coordinate files. Some standardised test data can be obtained from http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/, where the optimal solution is known.

Note: This is done in base R and no additional libraries are required.
